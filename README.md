# Sentiment-Analysis
Restaurant Reviews Analyser - Review polarity prediction

## Introduction:

•	Sentiment analysis is one of the Natural Language Processing fields, dedicated to the exploration of subjective opinions or feelings collected from various sources about a particular subject.

•	Sentiment Analysis is a set of tools to identify and extract opinions and use them for the benefit of the business operation.

•	In other words, opinion mining and sentiment analysis mean an opportunity to explore the mindset of the audience members and study the state of the product from the opposite point of view. This makes sentiment analysis a great tool for:

	Expanded product analytics
	Market research
	Reputation management
	Precision targeting
	Marketing analysis
	Public relations (PR)
	Product reviews
	Net promoter scoring
	Product feedback
	Customer service

## How, It works:

•	Sentiment analysis is a predominantly classification algorithm aimed at finding an opinionated point of view and its disposition and highlighting the information of particular interest in the process.

## Why, It Matters:

•	Sentiment Analysis deals with the perception of the product and understanding of the market through the lens of sentiment data.

•	There are many sources of public and private information out of which you can harness an insight into the customer’s perception of the product and general market situation. To name a few:

1.	Customer support correspondence (regarding your product)
2.	User-generated Product reviews
3.	Professional product reviews (as in The Verge or Wired)
4.	Social Media tractions
5.	General and special-purpose forums

## Objective:

•	The purpose of this analysis is to build a prediction model to predict whether a review on the restaurant is positive or negative. 

•	To do so, we will work on Restaurant Review dataset; we will load it into predictive algorithms Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. 

•	In the end, we hope to find a "best" model for predicting the review's sentiment.

•	To build a model to predict if review is positive or negative, following steps are performed.

1.	Importing Dataset
2.	Preprocessing Dataset
3.	Vectorization
4.	Training and Classification
5.	Analysis Conclusion

## What is Review Analysis ?

•	Sentiment analysis allows you to understand the nuances in customer reviews and pinpoint where an issue (or positive experience) stems from. 

•	Rather than responding the same way to every negative review, sentiment analysis provides insights that enable you to craft a better response. 

•	You’ll also be able to surface issues to the right department who can benefit from the feedback to make improvements.

•	Companies can also use sentiment analysis to put certain reviews at the top of the priority list. When sentiment analysis is used strategically, companies are better equipped to address negative feedback quickly and in a way that affects change.

## Technology used in project ?

•	Machine Learning Technology

## Algorithm of Project:

Step 1: 	Collection of data
Step 2: 	Prepare Data (Preprocessing) - This process is also called data analysis
		 - Cleaning Data
		 - Manipulating Data
		 - Scaling Data
Step 3: 	Initialize Algorithm or Model
Step 4: 	Train the Model (Formula Building and train the model)
Step 5: 	Test the Model (Testing data set)
Step 6: 	Make Prediction of unknown data of same object
Step 7: 	Model Evaluation
Step 8: 	Model Deployment

## Future of Sentiment Analysis:

•	Sentiment analysis is a uniquely powerful tool for businesses that are looking to measure attitudes, feelings and emotions regarding their brand. 

•	This project has been conducted almost exclusively by restaurants and brands through the use of social media data and reviews, survey responses and other hubs of user-generated content.

•	By investigating and analyzing customer sentiments, these brands are able to get an inside look at consumer behaviors and, ultimately, better serve their audiences with the products, services and experiences they offer.

•	The future of sentiment analysis is going to continue to dig deeper, far past the surface of the number of likes, comments and shares.

•	The aim to reach, and truly understand, the significance of social media interactions and what they tell us about the consumers behind the screens.
